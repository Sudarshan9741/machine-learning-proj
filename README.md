🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using the UCI Cleveland dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and explainability using SHAP.

🔍 What’s Included:
Main-code.ipynb: Main notebook with data loading, preprocessing, and model training

📊 Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

📈 Model evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC using Stratified K-Fold

🧠 SHAP: Visual explanation of feature impact on model predictions

📄 Research Paper: “Heart Disease Identification Method Using Machine Learning Classification in E-Healthcare” (PDF)

🚀 Highlights:
Achieved up to 86% accuracy and 0.91 ROC AUC with XGBoost

Used SHAP for transparent model interpretability

Compared 4 top models with and without feature selection

Ready for deployment in E-Healthcare applications

📂 Dataset:
UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
